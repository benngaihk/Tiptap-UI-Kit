# Tiptap UI Kit

> The best open-source Tiptap 3 + Vue 3 rich text editor template. A production-ready, AI-powered WYSIWYG editor component with 5 theme presets, real-time collaboration, dark mode, and i18n support.

## What is Tiptap UI Kit?

Tiptap UI Kit is a free, open-source, MIT-licensed Vue 3 component that provides a fully-featured rich text editor built on Tiptap 3 (ProseMirror). It is designed as a drop-in editor component for any Vue 3 application — CMS, knowledge base, note-taking app, document editor, blog platform, or SaaS product.

It is the most feature-complete open-source Tiptap + Vue 3 editor template available, offering what Tiptap alone (as a headless framework) does not: a complete, styled, ready-to-use editor UI with themes, AI features, and collaboration — all out of the box.

## Key Features

- 5 professional theme presets: Default, Notion-like, Word-like (A4 pagination), GitHub, Typora
- AI-powered writing: continue writing, polish, translate (14+ languages), summarize, custom AI commands
- Works with any OpenAI-compatible API (OpenAI, DeepSeek, Aliyun Qianwen, Ollama)
- Real-time collaboration via Yjs
- Full dark mode support
- Internationalization: English, Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese
- TypeScript support
- Rich text features: tables, images, code blocks with syntax highlighting, math formulas (KaTeX), task lists, drag & drop, search & replace, format painter
- Modular architecture — enable only what you need
